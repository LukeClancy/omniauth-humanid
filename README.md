# OmniAuth HumanID

Experimental Omniauth for humanID, a platform that prevents bots and increases privacy. I believe it has a foundation of some kind behind it that keeps it responsible.
Not sure on the details of that (not a lawyer), but either way the benefits of humanID are:

1. Increased privacy for users through both technical innovations and legal responsibilities
2. Making bots inconvienient by requiring phone verification
3. 'One voice one vote' type benefits by making it difficult to have multiple accounts
4. Dont have to deal with users putting in "password123" as a password
5. Dont have to deal with email/password registration generally (I will be happy to leave it behind)
6. Much better look than "sign up with [tech monopoly here]" buttons

## Before You Begin

Make an account at humanID, and get appropriate credentials

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
